Processing Examples for COMP258

Rough weekly topics for the programming lectures, with examples to go along with them:

Week 1: Introduction to Processing
* Example of how to make an app that is responsive to mouse clicks
* Example of how to draw ellipses, lines, etc, with/without strokes and fills, and how to choose colours
* Example of how to animate something by adjusting its position every frame

Week 2/3: Encapsulation
* Example of a single class with getter/setter methods and a draw method (e.g. bouncing ball)
* Example of a program with multiple classes (e.g. ???)
* Example of a class with a has-a relation to another class (e.g. a house composed of windows, a door etc)
* Example of a class containing a collection of objects from another class (e.g. a swarm composed of a list of insects)

Week 4: UI Library (not sure which one yet...)
* Examples of how to use single controls
* Examples of how to build a basic UI for an app

Week 5/6: Inheritance
* Example of a program with one class inheriting from another
* Example of a program with one class and multiple inheriting classes
* Example of a program with an abstract class

Week 7: Class Diagrams
* Example of a larger program with both is-a and has-a relationships (e.g. a random collage making program), along with the UML class diagram for it
 
Week 8: Ketai Library
* Example of an app that uses the touch screen display
* Example of an app that uses the position sensor
* Example of an app that uses the camera

Week 9/10: Polymorphism
* Example of a program with a typed collection of abstract elements (so all concrete elements are subclass instances)
* Example of a program without abstract where polymorphism makes sense

Week 11: PBox2D Library
* Example of how to move a single sprite
* Example of how to detect collisions
* Example of how to move several interacting sprites

Other Examples:
* A game using the 4-5 classes and the PBox2D and/or UI library, e.g. an angry birds type game
