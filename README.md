ProcessingExamples
==================

This archive contains the notes and examples I used to teach a course on object oriented programming using Processing. 

The course assumes students have already completed a first programming course adequately, i.e. they can write simple programs with functions, if/then statements, loops, etc. The examples here are therefore suitable for a *second* programming course.

The topics covered are:

01 Introduction
02 Encapsulation
03 User Interface & Object Composition
04 Testing and Debugging
05 Inheritance
06 Class Diagrams
07 Case Study 1
08 Polymorphism
09 Case Study 2
10 Revision
